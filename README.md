- basic principle works, but at the moment only SNP mutations, no structural stuff
- its slow but not too slow to show the general principle
- site come into strong LD around SD on the Y, but this can sometimes break down again such that the region of strong LD "oscillates" in time
- high mutation rates and low recombination rates with small pop sizes (strong drift) show the fastest/best effects

- lots of things to do: implement structural mutations, these probably crucial because SNPs accumulate not fast enough to make reduction of X-Y recombination complete and thus irreversible.

- Dan: to code up plotting modules, use the 100 iterations in "example.100_iterations.2019-06-05.tar.gz"
Should be self-explanatory. Just one parameter combination that was tweaked to show the desired effect.
Let me know if anything needs changing!
